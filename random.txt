!!! IMPORTANT !!
-- Figure out how model.generate() works and the meaning of these hyperparameters 


Steps of tuning hyperparameters: 
-- Adjust vocab size by T5Config 
-- Adjust size of training data 
-- Choose different variation of T5 models (other than t5-small. Check on what data size was each model trained) 
-- Introduce other hyperparameters, metrics, etc. (See toycode for outline) 



Important questions
-- What's the difference between model.forward() and model.generate()
-- How to check what are the available kwargs
-- What is grouped optimizer

output = zhTokenizer.encode(df_UN['zh'][0])
print(output.ids, output.tokens, output.offsets, output.attention_mask)
